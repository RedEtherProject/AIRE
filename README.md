Welcom to AIRE

A decentralized Application to Mock Twitter: Be Free To Say Your Thoughts Without Censorship by central authorities. 

Hack back your freedom of Speech into the Ether, and go on AIRE. 

For Free Thinkers who recognize the new Englightenment we are about to enter!

- Run by Solidity transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain

- to AIRE is to HUMAN; Freedom of Speech is a human right!
- POST functionality : AIRE your message into the Ether
  - non-blocking, non-censorship, nobody can get blocked off or reported by the platform, 
  - but there is a limit to how much you are allowed to AIRE for free every day, AIRE more than the limit and you can pay in ETH!
  - Followers can ECHO (analogous to a retweet) an AIRE, 
  - 
Functionalities: See the Wiki



Configs:


What is The Graph Protocol is a way of indexing data on decentralized Blockchains. 

-You can create your own subgraph to meet the requirements of you dApp


1. Set Up Graph Protocal Cli https://thegraph.com/docs/define-a-subgraph#install-the-graph-cli

 -if you aren't interested in the theory behind this and simply want to create a subgraph for you smart contract, simply go to quickstart
  a. set up Ganache CLI 
  b. start local Node Graph
  c. initialize new subgraph instance
  d. deploy example smart contract to Ganache(written in Solidity or Rust)
  e. use subgraph in React dApp Client

2. Write Mappings




Potential Other Networks
1. local testnet: Ganache
2. closure scope for injecting Web3: Metamask
3. Ethereum testnets: Ropsten, Rinkeby, Kovan 
3. Production: mainnet(require ETH)
